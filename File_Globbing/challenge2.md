# Matching with ?

- Challenge is to change the directory with ? replacing c and l.
- ? acts a wildcard but only for one entry. Therefore for double l use it as ??.
  
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{s12iozdhuRBBscyX493wjzJuKJ1.dJjM4QDL0gTN0czW}
```
- Once you successfully change the directory, execute run file like usual to get the flag.
