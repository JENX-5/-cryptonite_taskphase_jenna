# Foregrounding Processes

- The challenge is to foreground a background process.
- First, background a process like we did before by first suspending and then using bg.
- Then use fg and the process will now run in the foreground.
```bash
To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and *then* foreground it without re-suspending it! You can
background me with Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if
you're not ready to do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out. After that, resume me into the foreground with 'fg';
I'll wait.
hacker@processes~foregrounding-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
YES! Great job! I'm now running in the foreground. Hit Enter for your flag!
