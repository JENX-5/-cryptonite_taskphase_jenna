# Background Processes
- The challenge is to run two of same programs i.e  /challenge/run at the same time.
- We can do this by running one in the background and one like how we normally run a program.
- To run it in the background, first suspend and resume it by bg, which will basically run it in the background.
- Then in the terminal run the same program like usual.
- Now we have one running the background and one in the foreground

```bash
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          84 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out.
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S    bash /challenge/run
root          92 S    sleep 6h
root          93 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          95 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{UMdzwp_41hOsf_cK52YI3Zhvh6W.ddDN4QDL0gTN0czW}
```
