# Permission Tweaking Practice
- Same thing as before except had to do it eight times.
- Can give different permissions to file by seperating them by comma.
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run
Round 0 (of 8)!

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod ugo+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
