# Permissions Setting Practice
- Did use the topics in this challenge in the previous challenge.
- Not really much to do except keep changing the permissions as asked.

```bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ /challenge/run
Round 0 (of 8)!

Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-r--r--
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
* the group does have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw--wx-wx
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod ugo=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
