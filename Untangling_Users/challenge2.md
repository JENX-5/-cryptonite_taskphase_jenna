# Other Users with Su
- Instead of switching to the root user, you can change to another user by giving it as an argument to su.
- It will again ask the password

```bash
hacker@users~other-users-with-su:~$ su zardus
Password:
zardus@users~other-users-with-su:/home/hacker$ /challenge/run
Congratulations, you have become Zardus! Here is your flag:
